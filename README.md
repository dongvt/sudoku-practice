# The sudoku bundle
This repository is with the sole purpose to practice newer JS technologies (Libraries/Frameworks). I'm building a complete Sudoku. 
We are going to begging with react, then we will implement vue, and angular projects. I will add a react-native one too.

## Features
* The program shall allow the user to create a random sequence of numbers into a sudoku board
* The user shall be able to add numbers clicking in each box into the sudoku board, by typing the number or clicking in the number list at the bottom of the board
* ~~The user shall have three opportunities to continue the game if the number is typed wrong~~ (Depreciated for better gameplay)
* The program shall be able to show the user a hint

## Comments
I'm super tired of playing crappy sudoku with hundreds of announcements in each single page, and in the phone is worst since we get video announcements every 3 minutes.

## To Do
* [x] [React](./react-sudoku/)
* [ ] React Native
* [ ] Angular
* [ ] Vue
